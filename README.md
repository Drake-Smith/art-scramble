https://art-scramble.herokuapp.com/

Unscramble famous paintings of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands into the correct order by clicking and swapping image tiles.

## Built Using:
* React (bootstrapped with Create React App)
* ES6 JavaScript
* SCSS for enhanced CSS capability
* CSS Modules to locally scope CSS classes to each React component
* REST API provided by the Rijksmuseum. The API provides painting image tiles, and pertinent info about each painting.

## Future Improvements:
* The Rijksmuseum API provides images of their paintings broken into tiles that are not of equal height and width. Refactoring goals innclude utilizing the HTML5 Canvas API to split full images into equally-sized tiles.
